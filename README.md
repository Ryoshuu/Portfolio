# Portfolio

Welcome to the repository of my personal portfolio showcasing selected machine learning projects I have worked on so far. 

The projects focuses on end-to-end problem solving, including data preparation, modeling choices, evaluation, and practical trade-offs.

You can explore the individual project folders for details:
- [Favorita Sales Forecasts](https://github.com/Ryoshuu/Portfolio/tree/main/favorita-sales-forecasts) – Time series forecasting on multi-store, multi-product sales data with a focus on temporal structure and scalability.
- [MBTI Classification](https://github.com/Ryoshuu/Portfolio/tree/main/mbti-classification) – Supervised text classification using MBTI self-reported type labels, treated as an empirical target rather than a psychological ground truth, with careful handling of data imbalance and evaluation.
